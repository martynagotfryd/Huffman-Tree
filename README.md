# Huffman Tree Project

## Project Requirements
Write implementation of algorithm that creates Huffman tree and can encode and decode the sequence. Create Huffman tree using your own implementation of priority queue. Priority queue has to be written from scratch but you can choose implementation: naive, binary search tree etc.
Input is alphanumerical sequence. As a result, print Huffman code for all symbols in an input sequence and encoded input sequence.

## Project Overview
The Huffman Tree Project is an implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm, which is a popular method for lossless data compression. Huffman Coding assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. This project demonstrates how to build the Huffman Tree and encode and decode strings using this compression technique.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/martynagotfryd/Huffman-Tree.git
cd Huffman-Tree
```

2. Open the project in an IDE:
- Open the project using your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

3. Build the project:
- If using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, ensure dependencies are installed. Otherwise, configure the project and build it using your IDEâ€™s build system.

## Usage
This project allows you to input a string, build a Huffman Tree, and view the encoded and decoded results.

To run the program:
1. Input the text you wish to encode.
2. Execute the main class from your IDE or terminal.
